# UE2SelectionFixes
Binary fixes for multiple D3DDrv based UE2 editors

## Supported games
Right now, there are versions only for UT2004 3369 and Red Orchestra 3339

## Known bugs
Skyboxes render on top in the selection view. No known fix as of this moment, I'm currently looking into it
Right clicking on the void doesn't bring up the context menu. This will be fixed later.

## Code?
Nope, sorry. Lost it in a "boating" accident :)
